# Machine_Learning

## Overview of Machine Learning

This document is the starting point of my journey with machine learning. It defines
some key terms and gives my view of what machine learning is with little to 
no prior knowledge.

## Data Exploration
This is an introduction to C++ using data sets and how to create functions that are 
built-in in R but coding them in C++ gives a deeper understand to exactly how they work
and what they mean. The input was a .csv file with two data columns which were read in
and seperated into two vectors which were then used in different functions. The two
notable functions are the covariance and the correlation functions, which using the 
data provided in the inpute, calculates the covariance and correlation of the two.

You can see the code [here](data_exploration.cpp) and the document [here](Data_Exploration.pdf)


## Linear Regression/Bayes Net
This is an introduction to coding with linear regression and Naive Bayes network in R
as well as my first dive into R in general. It involved me and my group mate finding two
different data sets and applying different types of functions to manipulate and display
the data in different ways. There are two files, one is my dive into regression and the 
other is all about classification.
